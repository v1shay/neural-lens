# Neural Lens

Agentic Data Insight is an early-stage project exploring how agentic AI systems can provide useful insights on user-selected text and images directly within their workflow.

The goal of the project is to move beyond prompt-based chat tools and experiment with an AI system that can observe context, infer intent, and take structured actions over time.

## What This Project Is

- A learning and experimentation project focused on **agentic AI architecture**
- A system designed to analyze highlighted text or images and respond intelligently
- A combination of a browser-based interface and a Python backend
- A work in progress, built incrementally

---

## What This Project Is Not (Yet)

- Not a finished product
- Not production-ready
- Not optimized for performance or scale
- Not fully implemented

The current focus is on **architecture, structure, and correctness**, not completeness.

---

## High-Level Structure

- **Frontend**: A browser extension responsible for capturing user context and displaying responses
- **Backend**: An agent-based Python service responsible for reasoning and decision-making
- **Documentation**: Design notes outlining architecture and future direction

---

## Current Status

- Project structure and architecture defined
- Core files and folders scaffolded
- Initial agent skeletons in place
- Implementation will proceed step by step

---

## Purpose

This repository exists to explore:
- How agentic systems can be structured cleanly
- How responsibilities can be separated across agents
- How memory and decision-making can be handled explicitly

Functionality will be added gradually as the design solidifies.
